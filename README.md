**Notice**: The project was conceived on [ETH Prague 2023](https://ethprague.com/) hackathon. However, midway at 5pm on Saturday 10. 6. 2023 we decided to drop from submission based on the growing scope of the project, partial unavailabilities of team members and several parallel sicknesses and injuries. However, we will continue to contribute to the project.

Deployed with Vercel at https://ethprague23-eventlist.vercel.app/.
